# Limitations and Discussion

The issue of systemic resilience to natural and other hazards is an important
question for UDOT and many other agencies in the United States and around the
world, given the precarious situation of many of its transportation assets.
Flash floods, rockfalls, avalanches, earthquakes, and other incidents pose
threats to the network of independent transportation facilities. This research
did not consider risk assessment directly at any level, but rather took as a
given that 41 facilities were at some level of risk and played a potentially
large systemic role. A well-conceived approach to systemic resilience should
involve all three elements of resilience: hardening assets from failure through
high-quality engineering and construction; locating maintenance resources in
areas where they can most quickly resolve issues and return facilities optimal
conditions; and understanding how the system could work effectively in a damaged
or degraded state for medium to long periods of time if necessary.

This research focused on the systemic criticality of 41 facilities that were
assumed to fail independently. Some of the disaster scenarios most likely to
affect highway facilities -- especially a major earthquake -- are likely to
damage multiple highway assets simultaneously. This research might be extended
to consider what would happen if a set of highway facilities failed; is there a
facility that is not critical were it to fail by itself, but ends up being a
critical component of several combinations of failures? Taking the question
further, agencies might consider scenarios where emergency services or
evacuations must operate on a degraded network, an element of the emerging
research area of functional recovery [@zhan2022]. Of course, it is also an open
question as to whether destination and mode choices will follow the same
behavioral patterns in such a scenario.

This research developed a trip-based statewide transportation planning model
using model design practices -- including a destination choice trip distribution
model and a complete if rudimentary logit-based mode choice model. The model
presented in this research should not be used for infrastructure policy or
forecasting analyses, but is instead an illustrative tool. Many statewide
models, on the other hand, is a trip-based statewide transportation planning
model with a basic gravity-type trip distribution model and no mode choice
component. Using logit-based choice frameworks for trip distribution and mode
choice allows the model to incorporate greater sensitivity to influencing
variables and other benefits. It is recommended that agencies include a
logit-based mode and destination choice model as a bare minimum, if not a full
activity-based model as is becoming the standard practice.

The flexibility and sensitivity afforded by choice models can introduce some
additional challenges, however. The results of the logsum-based choice analysis
highlight one such risk, in that using different cost functions for network
skimming and destination choice can lead to inconsistent model behavior. In this
research and in the USTM highway assignment, vehicle trips between origins and
destinations are loaded onto the shortest time path, but their destinations are
chosen by a combination of travel time and path distance. Though this issue does
not always arise during calibration and typical volume forecasting efforts, it
represents a serious inconsistency in the travel model framework. Along the same
lines, this research included only a single feedback iteration; understanding
how many iterations are necessary for a travel model to successfully converge --
where the destinations chosen are no longer changing based on changes to travel
times between origins and destinations -- is an important model design decision
that was not explored here.

A potential limitation in the model developed for this research is that all HBW
trips are flexible in destination choice. This implies that a user could choose
to work in a different place when the path to their previously-chosen work
location is disrupted. This might not be entirely logical for short-term or even
medium-term highway closures, considering that most people will not switch jobs
so quickly. With the recent uptick in telecommuting instigated by the COVID-19
pandemic, workplace location is likely even more flexible now than it has been
in the past. This increased flexibility has already called into question how HBW
trips are handled in travel behavior modeling @salon2021. A more nuanced method
for estimating HBW trips that accounts for both flexibility and inflexibility of
workplace location might be developed.

Policies that result in a clear and certain outcome rare, though travel demand
models are sometimes mis-interpreted, mis-used, or even mis-designed to imply a
single policy prediction. Along the same lines, UDOT should take a proactive
role in helping travel modelers and transportation planners incorporate
uncertainty in their analysis and convey this uncertainty responsibly in
communications with transportation decision-makers and the general public.

# Conclusions

The question of systemic resilience of highway assets is an increasing concern
to agencies that must maintain critical infrastructure as it ages in the face of
a changing climate and economy. The basic tools of travel forecasting --- based
on coherent representations of human behavior --- provide compelling tools for
evaluating the criticality of individual highway assets. These tools may require
different expertise than more traditional agency engineers are usually equipped
with, but simplified or simplistic methods can lead to fundamentally different
evaluations of what may happen when the network changes. Demand modelers must
first equip their models with the tools to be useful outside of simple volume
forecasting, and then communicate with their stakeholders and peers the purpose
of the model and its powerful potential for helpful analysis.
