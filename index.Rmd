# Introduction {#intro}

Systemic resiliency is an important consideration for transportation agencies,
though specific definitions of "resiliency" might vary under different contexts.
Some agencies and researchers see resiliency as facility-level design and
engineering that hardens the system against failure [@bradley2007; @peeta2010];
others as an ability for maintenance staff to rapidly restore service following
catastrophe [@zhang2016]; and others as an ability for a system to continue
operating in degraded state [@berdica2002; @ip2011]. Regardless of the
definition used, assessing the resiliency of a transportation network --- and
addressing any potential shortfalls --- requires a method to identify which
links or facilities are most critical to the smooth operation of the network.

Identifying which links in a transportation network are most critical, however, 
is not trivial. State of the practice techniques typically rely on traffic volumes
represented in terms of vehicles, trips, or freight value [@aem2017]. But these 
methods ignore the fact that some networks have alternate routes readily available,
have multiple well developed modes of transportation, or have redundant
destination locations. When a network link does break, routes, mode choice, and
destination choice often change too. These responses have been observed in
real-world crisis events like the I-35 W bridge collapse in Minneapolis and the
I-85 bridge fire and collapse in Atlanta
[@zhu2010; @levinson2010; @xie2011; @hamedi2018].

In this research, we apply destination choice accessibility model to identify
critical highway links in a statewide highway context. This model is designed to
capture the utility lost to individuals operating on a degraded network who may
choose a longer route, a different travel mode, or a different destination. We
then apply the model to a highway network representing the state of Utah. The
model structure permits a more nuanced evaluation of link criticality than using
traffic volume alone or in conjunction with an increased travel time measure.

The paper proceeds as follows. First, a [literature review](#litreview) discusses
previous attempts to analyze the resiliency of transportation networks. A
[methodology](#methodology) section presents the model developed for this
research and describes the implementation process in Utah. A [results](#results) section
describes the model output in detail for one scenario and then compares and ranks
the model outputs for an array of several dozen independent scenarios. The paper
[concludes](#conclusion) with a discussion of limitations and associated avenues 
for future research.
