# Introduction {#intro}

Systemic resiliency is an important consideration for transportation agencies.
Researchers such as [@berdica2002;
@geurs2004; @rogers2012; @omer2013] have all extensively researched and
discussed the importance of network resiliency over the last 20 years. However,
none have been able to implement a methodology capable of examining a systems
resiliency on a large scale. This research seeks to develop a model capable of
determining the effects experienced by a transportation network after damage to
the network occurs.

Identifying critical links is difficult, because the most critical links may not
be trivial to identify. Many networks have alternate routes readily available,
have multiple well developed modes of transportation, or have redundant
destination locations. When a network link does break, routes, mode choice, and
destination choice often change too. These responses have been observed in
real-work crisis events like the I-35 W bridge collapse in Minneapolis and the
I-85 bridge fire and collapse in Atlanta [@zhu2010; @levinson2010; @xie2011;
@hamedi2018].

In this research, we present a model to identify critical highway links. We then
apply the model to a highway network representing the state of Utah. The
logit-based destination choice model allows road users to first choose a mode of
transportation based on the utility of that mode, and then allows the user to
choose a destination based on utility and attractiveness of that destination.
The model structure allows greater accuracy to be achieved because the logsum
value better represents user choice than traditional models.

The paper proceeds as follows. First, a [literature review](#litreview) discusses
previous attempts to analyze the resiliency of transportation networks. A
[methodology](#methodology) section presents the model developed for this
research and describes the implementation process in Utah. A [results](#results) section
describes the model output in detail for one scenario and then compares and ranks
the model outputs for an array of several dozen independent scenarios. The paper
[concludes](#conclusion) with a discussion of limitations and associated avenues 
for future research.
