# Introduction {#intro}

## Problem Statement
The Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) is responsible for maintaining a
transportation system to promote public welfare and economic activity throughout
the state. UDOT is also responsible to maintain key components of the national
highway transportation system. Given the importance of this system, UDOT has
sought in the last several years to identify which facilities are most critical
to the smooth operations of this system. 

In 2017, AEM (2017) completed a risk and resilience analysis for the I-15
corridor on behalf of UDOT. This analysis quantified risk as the probability of
threats (earthquakes, floods, fires, etc.) multiplied by the criticality of the
asset to the overall system were such threats to materialize. The AEM analysis
has two primary limitations. First, the methods are proprietary to AEM and UDOT
cannot now apply the methods to study the criticality of other transportation
corridors with regional and national significance (e.g. U.S. Route 6, Interstate
70). But more importantly, the current index treats each UDOT asset – each
bridge, highway segment, etc. – as an independent unit when in fact UDOT
operates a system of transportation facilities. The criticality of a single
bridge to the overall system is not determined by the volume of traffic it
supports directly, but by how inconvenient it would be for that traffic to find
another path or destination were the bridge to fail. Resiliency must therefore
be considered a function of network alternatives, or redundancy.

## Objective
The primary objective of this research is to develop a methodology and tool to
evaluate the network redundancy of critical UDOT assets across the state. We
base this tool on data collected for the Utah Statewide Travel Model (USTM),
with certain improvements and additional model features to more accurately
capture the economic costs associated with an impaired state highway network. In
particular, we develop a method that explicitly considers the availability of
alternative destinations, modes, and routes to individuals traveling on the
impaired network. A secondary objective of this research is to apply the model
to evaluate the criticality of specific highway links in Utah by comparison.
This report presents the results of this evaluation applied on 41 individual
highway links.

## Scope

The purpose of the resiliency model is to provide a working model that can be
used to evaluate the potential economic costs were a highway link – or a set of
highway links – to be damaged or destroyed temporarily in Utah. This model is
based in the theory of logit choice modeling and shortest path finding in a
network. The specific choice utility equations in the model represent a
plausible utility outcome, but the focus of this research has not been on
developing robust utility equations or calibrated volume-delay functions. This
model is therefore not designed to forecast traffic volumes or designed for any
purpose other than providing a comparative estimate of the effects of link loss
by man-made or natural causes.

## Outline
This report is organized as follows: 
-Chapter 1.	This introductory chapter.
-Chapter 2.	A Literature Review, summarizing previous attempts to model network
resiliency using the choices and accessibility of individuals on the impacted
network. 
-Chapter 3.	This chapter presents a proposed model design and
implementation of the model within the CUBE transportation planning software
application. This chapter also describes model calibration efforts.
-Chapter 4.	This chapter presents a method for identifying vulnerable and
potentially critical highway links by considering the location-based elevated
risk issues. This chapter summarizes a previous study conducted by BIO-WEST.
-Chapter 5.	A Model Application, describing and comparing the results of the
model developed in Chapter 3 to the highway links identified in Chapter 4.
-Chapter 6.	A Conclusions chapter summarizing the findings and providing
additional recommendations to UDOT.
