# Introduction {#intro}

Systemic resiliency is an important consideration for transportation agencies.
(Intro Paragraph, probably a couple of references needed.)

Identifying critical links is difficult, because the most critical links may not
be trivial to identify. (Elaborate why not: alternate routes, modes, destinations)
These responses have been obsvered in real-work crisis events like the I-35 W bridge 
collapse in Minneapolis and the I-85 bridge fire and collapse in Atlanta 
[@zhu2010; @levinson2010; @xie2011; @hamedi2018].

In this research, we present a model to identify critical highway links. We then
apply the model to a highway network representing the state of Utah. (briefly
describe how the model operates and its basis in literature)

The paper proceeds as follows. First, a [literature review](#litreview) discusses
previous attempts to analyze the resiliency of transportation networks. A
[methodology](#methodology) section presents the model developed for this
research and describes the implementation in Utah. A [results](#results) section
describes the model output in detail for one scenario and then compares and ranks
the model outputs for an array of several dozen independent scenarios. The paper
[concludes](#conclusion) with a discussion of limitations and associated avenues 
for future research.
