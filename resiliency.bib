  abstract = {Pedestrian travel offers a wide range of benefits to both individuals and society. Planners and public health officials alike have been promoting policies that improve the quality of the built environment for pedestrians: mixed land uses, interconnected street networks, sidewalks and other facilities. Whether such policies will prove effective remains open to debate. Two issues in particular need further attention. First, the impact of the built environment on pedestrian behavior may depend on the purpose of the trip, whether for utilitarian or recreational purposes. Second, the connection between the built environment and pedestrian behavior may be more a matter of residential location choice than of travel choice. This study aims to provide new evidence on both questions. Using 1368 respondents to a 1995 survey conducted in six neighborhoods in Austin, TX, two separate negative binomial models were estimated for the frequencies of strolling trips and pedestrian shopping trips within neighborhoods. We found that although residential self-selection impacts both types of trips, it is the most important factor explaining walking to a destination (i.e. for shopping). After accounting for self-selection, neighborhood characteristics (especially perceptions of these characteristics) impact strolling frequency, while characteristics of local commercial areas are important in facilitating shopping trips.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the properties and performance of a new measure of accessibility, called the activity-based accessibility (ABA) measure, and compares it to traditional measures of accessibility, including isochrone, gravity and utility-based measures. The novel aspect of the ABA is that it measures accessibility to all activities in which an individual engages, incorporating constraints such as scheduling, and travel characteristics such as trip chaining. The ABA is generated from the day activity schedule (DAS) model system, an integrated system based on the concept of an activity pattern, which identifies the sequence and tour structure among all the activities and trips taken by an individual during a day. A byproduct is an individual's expected maximum utility over the choices of all available activity patterns, and from this the ABA is derived. The ABA is related to the logsum accessibility measures frequently derived from destination and mode discrete choice models. The key difference is that it is generated not by examining a particular trip, but by examining all trips and activities throughout the day. A case study using data from Portland, Oregon, demonstrates the rich picture of accessibility made available by use of the ABA, and highlights differences between the ABA and more traditional measures of accessibility. The ABA is successful in (a) capturing taste heterogeneity across individuals (not possible with aggregate accessibility measures), (b) combining different types of trips into a unified measure of accessibility (not possible with trip-based measures), (c) reflecting the impact of scheduling and trip chaining on accessibility (not possible with trip-based measures), and (d) quantifying differing accessibility impacts on important segments of the population such as unemployed and zero auto households (not possible with aggregate measures, and limited with trip-based measures).}

Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the effort for calculations and the difficulty of interpretation. The current practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or land-use and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the inclusion of individual's spatial\textendash temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behaviour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and non-user benefits, and the measurement of different components of accessibility.},

A disaggregate logsum accessibility measure using the Dutch national land-use/transport interaction model TIGRIS XL is used to compute changes in consumer surplus. The measure provides an elegant and convenient solution to measure the full accessibility benefits from land-use and/or transport policies, when discrete choice travel-demand models are available that already produce logsums. It accounts for both changes in generalised transport costs and changes in destination utility, and is thus capable of providing the accessibility benefits from changes in the distribution of activities, due to transport or land-use policies. The case study shows that logsum accessibility benefits from land-use policy strategies can be quite large compared to investment programmes for road and public transport infrastructure, largely due to changes in trip production and destination utility, which are not measured in the standard rule-of-half benefit measure.},

Resilience in these networks was evaluated alongside that of a biological network, which through millions of years of evolution had developed an adaptive behavior in which cost, efficiency, and resilience were optimized in the feeding network that was constructed. Disruptions in the networks were simulated by using link-based targeted and random strategies. With simulation results, network performance under disruption was assessed by using two metrics: global efficiency and the relative size of the giant component for each disruption strategy. The biological network exhibits superior resistance to disruption regardless of strategy, a quality attributed to its redundant and cyclic weblike network structure and its innate ability to adapt to disruptions by developing network structures that have been honed through millions of years of evolution. In addition, linear correlations between network structural metrics such as the average degree, density, and average clustering coefficient were explored and analyzed.}

Each link may be either operational or non-functional after the disaster. The link failure probabilities are assumed to be known a priori, and investment decreases the likelihood of failure. The planning problem seeks connectivity for first responders between various origin\textendash destination (O\textendash D) pairs and hence focuses on uncapacitated road conditions. The decision-maker's goal is to select the links to invest in under a limited budget with the objective of maximizing the post-disaster connectivity and minimizing traversal costs between the origin and destination nodes. The problem is modeled as a two-stage stochastic program in which the investment decisions in the first stage alter the survival probabilities of the corresponding links. We restructure the objective function into a monotonic non-increasing multilinear function and show that using the first order terms of this function leads to a knapsack problem whose solution is a local optimum to the original problem. Numerical experiments on real-world data related to strengthening Istanbul's urban highway system against earthquake risk illustrate the tractability of the method and provide practical insights for decision-makers.},

  abstract = {Every day dependence on transportation grows as local, regional, national, and international independence increases. Resilient transportation systems are needed to secure the highest possible level of service during disruptive events, including natural disasters and those caused by humans. To prepare for these events, decision makers need guidance to determine what investments are likely to improve the resiliency of their networks, which are often hampered by limited resources. To date, such guidance has been primarily qualitative. This paper presents a methodology to quantify resiliency, under preevent conditions, by use of a fuzzy inference approach. This methodology expands on previous work by the authors and others, by refining the definitions of key variables, adjusting model interactions, and increasing transparency between metrics. The paper includes a case study in which the methodology is applied to a disruptive event in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The case study illustrates the methodology's ability to (a) evaluate the extent to which the Dominican Republic's transportation network is prepared for a disruptive event, (b) help select investments that have the potential to increase the resiliency of the network, and (c) provide outputs that will support a variety of current economic analysis strategies, allow comparison of different investment scenarios, and facilitate decision making. The paper concludes with a sensitivity analysis that shows the effects of alternative investments on the network.}

  abstract = {Transport user benefits are of great importance in cost\textendash benefit analysis when transport projects are appraised. Generally, these benefits have the greatest effect on the results of cost\textendash benefit analyses. It is common to adopt the consumer surplus for calculating transport user benefits. The consumer surplus measure is based on the underlying demand model and follows from the integration of the demand curve. If the popular logit model is used for forecasting travel demand, a consumer surplus measure takes a closed form that is easy to calculate. Furthermore, in cost\textendash benefit analyses the change in consumer surplus between an initial and final state is needed; the change can be easily derived by the difference of the logsums of the two states. This logsum approach is proven and correct for travel demand models based on the logit model without multiple constraints. However, for travel demand models dealing with two or more sets of constraints, the logsum approach fails. In this paper, a mathematical approach is described for a transport user benefits measure that corresponds to the consumer surplus and is universal for all travel demand models with constraints. The measure for a doubly constrained trip distribution is derived. The applicability of the derived approach is shown by a simple example.}

  abstract = {Redundancy is vital for transportation networks to provide utility to users during disastrous events. In this paper, we develop two network-based measures for systematically characterizing the redundancy of transportation networks: travel alternative diversity and network spare capacity. Specifically, the travel alternative diversity dimension is to evaluate the existence of multiple modes and effective routes available for travelers or the number of effective connections between a specific origin-destination pair. The network spare capacity dimension is to quantify the network-wide residual capacity with an explicit consideration of travelers' mode and route choice behaviors as well as congestion effect. They can address two fundamental questions in the pre-disaster transportation system evaluation and planning, i.e., ``how many effective redundant alternatives are there for travelers in the event of a disruption?'' and ``how much redundant capacity does the network have?'' To implement the two measures in practice, computational methods are provided to evaluate the network redundancy. Numerical examples are also presented to demonstrate the features of the two redundancy measures as well as the applicability of the computational methods. The analysis results reveal that the two measures have different characterizations on network redundancy from different perspectives, and they can complement each other by providing meaningful information to both travelers and planners.},

  abstract = {The abstract representation of a transportation system as a network of nodes and interconnecting links, whether that system involves roadways, railways, sea links, airspace, or intermodal combinations, defines a network topology. Among the most common in the context of transportation systems are the grid, ring, hub-and-spoke, complete, scale-free and small-world networks. This paper investigates the role of network topology, and the topology's characteristics, in a transportation system's ability to cope with disaster. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that the topological attributes of a transportation system significantly affect its resilience to disaster events. Resilience accounts for not only the innate ability of the system to absorb externally induced changes, but also cost-effective and efficient, adaptive actions that can be taken to preserve or restore performance post-event. Comprehensive and systematically designed numerical experiments were conducted on 17 network structures with some relation to transportation system layout. Resilience of these network structures in terms of throughput, connectivity or compactness was quantified. Resilience is considered with and without the benefits of preparedness and recovery actions. The impact of component-level damage on system resilience is also investigated. A comprehensive, systematic analysis of results from these experiments provides a basis for the characterization of highly resilient network topologies and conversely identification of network attributes that might lead to poorly performing systems.},

  abstract = {Transportation infrastructure has been identified by the US Department of Homeland Security as one of sixteen critical infrastructure systems essential to the well-being of modern societies. In this study, we propose a resilience-based framework for mitigating risk to surface road transportation networks. We utilize recent developments in modern network theory to introduce a novel metric based on system reliability and network connectivity to measure resilience-based performance of a road transportation network. The formulation of this resilience-based performance metric (referred in the paper as WIPW), systematically integrates the network topology, redundancy level, traffic patterns, structural reliability of network components (i.e. roads and bridge) and functionality of the network during community's post-disaster recovery, and permits risk mitigation alternatives for improving transportation network resilience to be compared on a common basis. Using the WIPW as a network performance metric, we propose a project ranking mechanism for identifying and prioritizing transportation network retrofit projects that are critical for effective pre-disaster risk mitigation and resilience planning. We further present a decision methodology to select optimal solutions among possible alternatives of new construction, which offer opportunities to improve the resilience of the network by altering its existing topology. Finally, we conclude with an illustration that uses the WIPW as the performance metric to support risk-based mitigation decisions using a hypothetical bridge network susceptible to seismic hazards.},

  abstract = {On August 1, 2007, the collapse of the I-35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis abruptly interrupted the usual route of about 140,000 daily vehicle trips, which substantially disturbed regular traffic flow patterns on the network. It took several weeks for the network to re-equilibrate, during which period travelers continued to learn and adjust their travel decisions. A good understanding of this process is crucial for traffic management and the design of mitigation schemes. Data from loop-detectors, bus ridership statistics, and a survey are analyzed and compared, revealing the evolving traffic reactions to the bridge collapse and how individual choices could help to explain such dynamics. Findings on short-term traffic dynamics and behavioral reactions to this major network disruption have important implications for traffic management in response to future scenarios.},
